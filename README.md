## Context: 
 
To understand the information described in the visualization, a minimum knowledge about health and the variables that can influence it is required. The project seeks to develop basic research in the area of health of the variables of health, nutrition, and intestinal microbiota. Previous studies in different populations found in the world that the intestinal microbiota changes concerning the various health states of the individual [1], some studies that the intestinal microbiota changes with diet [2]. Taking into account that changing the diet is one of the outstanding methodologies to improve the health of people, in general, it is essential to identify the relationship between diet, intestinal microbiota, and health. 
 
## Target audiences: 
 
For the general user, the visualization can describe sociodemographic variables of the sample of the Colombian population, a description of the Colombian diet, show some trends in the main macronutrients of the diet and illustrate the main taxonomic groups of bacteria found in The intestinal microbiota of individuals. 
 
For the user with previous knowledge in the areas of biological sciences and health, the visualization allows describing joint trends in the analysis of the macronutrients of the diet, the nutritional status and the length of the different sociodemographic characteristics and shows the modifications in different taxa Of interest in health recognizable in literature reports. 
 
### Que? 
 
There is information in the form of a table for 441 people, each with their report on diet, health and intestinal microbiota, data from the gut microbiota and the data set in the form of a matrix where the entirety of the OTUs described. Taxonomic of operation) that are artificial elements that ideally represent species of bacteria, each OTU is assigned to taxonomy that allows generating a hierarchical description of the data. There is no geospatial data or time series. 
 
#### Type of data: 
 
-Category (city, sex, classification of nutritional status, classification of health status) 
 
-Ordinals - Quantitative sequential (all variables of diet, socio-demographic variables: age, stratum, and all health variables) 
 
- Qualitative - ordinal - sequential (classification of nutritional status) 
 
### Why? 
 
Main task No 1: To explore the information described by the different aspects collected (variables or attributes) available in a sample of the Colombian population. Explore, features: Given the vast amount of information and variables available. 
 
Summarize, All data: Create a synthesis of the data on one of the attributes: health, diet or microbiota. 

A-. Categorize the relationship between the elements (possibility of creating data groups) Derive, Characteristics: Create groupings based on gut microbiota abundance data, clusters based on data. 
B. Discriminate the data by the different sociodemographic variables Compare, characteristics of similarity: compare the data of the main themes of the attributes of age group, sex, and city 
C. Find the factors that affect health Locate, Characteristics: Look for the factors related to the performance of cardiovascular health D. Enjoy navigation through the different visualization charts Enjoy: That the information found is pleasing to the eye 
 
Main task No.2: Identify patterns in the topics of intestinal microbiota, diet, and health in a sample of the Colombian population. Identify, trends: Identify at least one item for each of the central themes that relate to each other. 
 
Secondary tasks of the main task No.1: A. Identify dependencies between the different topics Discover, dependcy: locate dependencies between the variables B. Classification of the data regarding health or not Derivation, Characteristics: Create groups of data that strongly grouped between them C. Extreme data identification data, outliers: Identify individuals with 
 
### How? 
 
#### IDIOM1 - Multiple filtered graphics 
 
Boards 
Bar charts 
Multi-line chart 
Heatmap with small multiples 
IDIOM2 - Horizontal dendrogram Marks: Points for nodes and Lines for hierarchical connections based on taxonomy Channels: tree design, based on the different taxonomic categories (phylum, order, class, family, gender, species) Coding: Separating, ordering, Align, Reduce : Filter (from Previous IDIOM and Added by the name of the taxon in the taxonomy

## Insights:

- There is a homogenous number of people throughout different cities, sex, and nutritional status.
- Two-thirds of the studied population is overweight or obese
- There is a tendency of association between the fat and protein, which is inversely proportional to the carbohydrates. Some data refers to a high level of proteins with a low level of fat and vision. What indicates that the diet can be variable between each
- Checking the calorie map the OTUs present in most of the individuals of all the cities are in the first 36 OTU which  used as generic descriptors of the said OTUs are of interest to review them in detail later
- According to what  reported. Each one has its name. You are usual? Does the studied population know what a healthy diet is?
- All taxonomic families  described as describing a similar way to the length of the different states of health, the range of the various cities and the sex of the people, their part is the dependence on abundance despite the differences between the - - Different variables is small.
- Among the different cities of the relative abundance of taxa are similar between Bogotá, Medellín, and Barranquilla, where there is a more significant amount of Bacteroidetes observed and a decrease in the amount of Actinobacteria
- When comparing the abundance of the different families of bacteria, no marked differences were found between the different nutritional states of the studied cohort
- If differences  observed in the abundance of specific taxonomic groups, for example, in others, with nutritional status, regular, higher, relative, relative to biological diversity.
